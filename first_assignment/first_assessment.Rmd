```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Exercise 1


My forked version of the assignment template repository can be found at https://github.com/editor210/472_assignment_template


## Exercise 2

For the second exercise I have chosen to work with the ChickWeight Dataset.
This Dataset presents 578 rows and 4 variables (Weight, time, Chick, Diet).

The Weight is a numeric vector representing the weight of chickens in grams

```{r chicks, echo= FALSE}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
